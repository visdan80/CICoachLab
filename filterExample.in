# In this file the exercises and settings can be provided with labels and filtering
# The filtering defines if the items are visibles in general and/or dependent on the difficulty level of the user.
# 
# The setting XXX in CICoachLab defines if settings, which are not defined in filter.ini will be visibles.
# 
# If the visibility of an item (e.g. exercise) is set to visibless = False and the visibility of a subitem is set to True
# the subitem (its setting) will not be displayed
# The dificulties of the exercises and settings of the exercise define the difficulty from 1 (very easy) to 5 (difficult)
# The information in infos can bes provided for example as short discription in a  tooltip while hovering over selection
# The fields names, labels, difficulties, infos, visibless are mandatory
# The modules which are define as py files in CI Trainer but are not listed in filter.ini will not be displayed
# Even if the module is not displayed to the user the item can be called by CICoachLab (e.g. by an setlist).
# Boolean value have to be assigned as True or False
# infos have to be provided in the format as follows: infos = "example1","example2","example3"
# If a single item is entered the item has to be closed with a semicolon. If two or more items are entered the final colon
# should be entered but can be skipped.
#
# A single item example
