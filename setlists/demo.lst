# The setlist defines a set of exercises with specified settings which will be run in serie
# automatically as long the exercises have been finished successfully. 
# The sussessfull run can be defined by pre or post conditions in 
# separate the entries by colons
# default settings can be defined by by an empty value or 'default'
#
# If the same exercise, generator, preProc, or player are used for different 
# settings respectively it is sufficient to  define a single name. Otherwise  
# ensure that the number of items in name and settings are the same within the
# sections.# The entries of preprocessors can be empty since the use of preprocessors is
# not mandatory. Otherwise enter None, if no preProc should be used, especially 
# if in one instance of settings a preProc should be used and in other 
# instances no preProc is used.
#
# Attention!
# If a preProcessor is defined in the exercise setting the exercise setttings
# overrule the definitions in the set list.
# The same applies for the  generator and player settings.
