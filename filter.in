# 
# This file  can be used to translate the exercise names and to define the exercise user access in CICoachLab.
# The user access defines if the items are visibles in general and/or dependent on the difficulty level of the user.
# The labels can be used to provide telling names instead of the programmers python script names. The labels can also be used 
# to provide translations or group specific names for the exercise and settings names.
# 
# The setting/field 'ignoreFilterFile' in CICoachLab.ini defines if this file will be ignored.
# 
# If the visibility of an item (e.g. exercise) is set to visibless = False and the visibility of a subitem is set to True
# the subitem (its setting) will not be displayed
# The dificulties of the exercises and settings of the exercise define the difficulty from 1 (very easy) to 5 (difficult)
# The information in infos can bes provided for example as short discription in a  tooltip while hovering over selection
# The fields names, labels, difficulties, infos, visibless are mandatory
# The modules which are define as py files in CI Trainer but are not listed in filter.ini will not be displayed
# Even if the module is not displayed to the user the item can be called by CICoachLab (e.g. by an setlist).
# Boolean value have to be assigned as True or False
# infos have to be provided in the format as follows: infos = "example1","example2","example3"
# If a single item is entered the item has to be closed with a semicolon. If two or more items are entered the final colon
# should be entered but can be skipped.
#
# A single item example
# [[settings]]
# [[[playAudio]]]
# names = playAudio1,
# labels = Grundeinstellung,
# difficulties = 1,
# infos = "Grundeinstellung der Standard-Audio-Ausgabe des Rechners",
# visibless = True,
# 
#
# Trouble shooting:
# filter.ini cannt be read
# 1) Check if the field names are defined corecctly
# 2) check the usage of colons.
#       The field names should be close with a colon, even empty entrie, e.g.:
#       [[settings]]
#       [[[playAudio]]]
#       names = ,
#       labels = ,
#       difficulties = ,
#       infos = ,
#       visibles = , 
# 3) If colons are used within definitions the labels/information have to be be enclosed in quoatation marks.
#
# The exercise or setting is not displayed although it is defined in filter.ini
# 1) Check the predefined difficulty and difficulty level. If the difficulty level in the user dialog is lower than the 
#       difficulty defined in filter.ini the item won't be displayed.
