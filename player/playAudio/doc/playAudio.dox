\section sec_introductionPlayAudio playAudio
This simple audio player uses a basic python package to play back the audio signal.
The control of the audio signal is restricted to the starting, pausing and stopping of the audio signal.

The progress in the software flow defaults to waiting until the audio signal is played back but can be set otherwise.
